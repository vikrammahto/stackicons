# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, JavaScript has evolved to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It runs on virtually every platform and is supported by all modern web browsers without the need for plug-ins.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- **First-class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments
- **Prototype-based OOP**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **Event-driven Programming**: Responds to user interactions and system events
