# TypeScript

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

Developed by Microsoft and first released in 2012, TypeScript has become increasingly popular in enterprise applications and large-scale JavaScript projects.

## Key Benefits

- **Static Type Checking**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Support for latest ECMAScript features
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be adopted incrementally in existing JavaScript projects
