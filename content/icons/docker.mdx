# Docker

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

Docker was first released in 2013 and has revolutionized how applications are deployed and managed, enabling consistent environments from development to production.

## Key Concepts

- **Containers**: Lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient runtime environments
- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Dockerfile**: Script containing instructions to build Docker images
- **Docker Hub**: Cloud-based registry for sharing container images
